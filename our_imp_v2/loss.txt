STEPS
0. use full sequence data somehow? to train? 
1. try with baseline faster rcnn
	a. score_thresh = 8.0, 5.0 / iou_thresh = 0.5, 0.5
2. try with baseline yolo
	a. score_thresh = 8.0, 5.0 / iou_thresh = 0.5, 0.5


Focus fine tune on simply improving on best thresholds seen by baseline tests:
^^^LINKED TO QUESTION


3. fine tune attempt
	a. train dataset to train and test to eval on test
	
	train with 10 frames per sequence, 50 epochs
	train with 20 frames per sequence, 25 epochs
	
	QUESTION!!!
	***b. should we eval both models on [8, 5] [5, 5], or just 
		don best one for each - so we can focus on 
			different approaches to training we tried
	
	
	
	ONLY FOR FRCNN: (explore after AD has eval results
	 	(with best thresthold setting) for yolo	exactly
	 			 mirroring frcnn 2 trainings)	
	... could we add this extra set of results I kinda organized
	For each finetuning model:
	Train on: 20 frames per sequence, 25 epochs
	Train on: 10 frames per sequence, 50 epochs 
	
	
	TALK TO AD:
	
	I already did 10f, 50e vs 20f, 25e
	
(WANT TO TRY BUT probably no time unless we completely scrap something else):

	20f, 100(or 50 if no time)e because it was better than 10f 50e
	30f 25e to see if it trended to be better than 20f
	
	IF WE DO THIS: completely scrap other thing + only one threshold set?

	Pros: 	we can discuss the tradeoffs of training more epochs with less 
			frames per sequence, and less epochs with more frames 
			per sequence
		
		try out cool trend we see with 20 frames learning well
			 
	Cons:	makes the report that much more image filled with a bit less
		 wordage (Pro or Con?)
		 
		 you have to do all these same trainings for yolo

	
	TODO: yolo - train
		train with 10 frames per sequence, 50 epochs
		train with 20 frames per sequence, 25 epochs
		
		extra stuff? 
	


4. results
	Talk about results of fine tuning overall (not long)
5. Understanding faster rcnn
	our experimentation
6. use yolo + sequence (I DONT EVEN THINK WE NEED THIS) 








get results of training with this 50 random frames from sequeneces and training

	get graph with 10 epochs

	50f takes ~4:30 per epoch



evaluate with ONLY TEST SET: DONE
